        />

        <p>I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I did my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from there. Little after my graduation, I came to the USA with my husband. I did my MBA in accounting and teaching certification. Currently, I am a High school MAth teacher. I have three kids-2 daughters and a son. 
                In my free time, I like to watch TV and read books. My favorite TV series is "The Office".

        <p> Nowadays, we cannot think of a single day where we don't visit a website from our gadgets. The world is running on the internet. Web development allows us to express ourselves creatively on the internet. As a web developer, I will have the freedom to work from anywhere. All I need for web development is the internet and a laptop. It's also a job that provides a decent income. In this field, I can learn new staff continuously.
